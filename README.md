# Angular Extended Independent Project
by James Osborn

## Topic List
Here are some areas I'd like to focus on improving in order to become a better developer.

### Design
My work at Epicodus has been largely focused on back-end languages. I often don't style my projects because I'm focused on the functionality first. I'd like to take some lessons on the design side to improve on my ability to give my projects great styles.
* UI/UX Design
* Wireframes
* Photoshop
* Illustrator


### Databases
Being able to manage databases is going to be vital to my future as a back-end developer, both for working for my future employer and for any independent projects I decide to take on. It's important that I know the fundamentals of several different databases and their languages, in order to compare/contrast their usefulness and use the right one for the right project, and to become a developer with a diverse skillset.
* Firebase
* SQL


### Coding with New Languages
Now that I've learned the basics of a few different languages, I feel I'm ready to branch out and start to learn another language. Ruby and Python have interested me. I should compare and contrast the two further to decide which one I might want to learn next.

Additionally, I want to keep reviewing and expanding on languages I've learned in the past, to keep those skills sharp and up to date.

* Ruby
* Python
* C++

### Keeping Up With Known Languages

I want to keep reviewing and expanding on languages I've learned in the past, both to keep those skills sharp and up to date, and to learn the newest features.

* C# and Visual C
* MVC with C#
* .NET
* Asynchrony
* Exception Handling
* Parsing data from API calls

### Project Management

I really like working with small teams of developers, finding out what their strengths are, and then figuring out ways to help us all come together and accomplish great things. I want to expand on my experience as a project manager and search out employment opportunities in this subsect of the tech industry.

* Project Management
* Game Development & Unity
* Technical Terminology

### Employment Preparation

I'm looking forward to taking some of the skills I've learned and putting them into practice in the field. In order to prepare myself for upcoming interviews, I'd like to focus on:


* Whiteboarding Practice
* Interview Practice
* Writing Cover Letters
* Resume Preparation
* Improving my LinkedIn
* Blog posts
* Technical Writing
* Giving Presentations

### New Spoken languages
I've worked on some really diverse teams in the past, and I know how much diversity adds to a groups dynamics and success. I'd be very interested international employment at some point in my career, if that were a possibility. And I'd like to increase my knowledge of the world at large by learning a new spoken language.

* Improving Spanish
* Learning Japanese


## What does it mean to be a good developer?

## Taking a Break: A Lesson From Metal Dog

2009 -- One random evening in my university days, I was playing an online video game called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It was a very popular game at the time with millions of players worldwide. Over the chat channel I heard someone say, "OMG, it's Metal Dog! Metal Dog is in our game!!! Metal Dog! Ahhhhh!"

"Who's Metal Dog?" someone else asked. Metal Dog, with a bunch of Xs and numbers interspersed in his gamertag, was the Number 1 player in CoD: MW2 on Xbox 360, the first person informed us. I checked the scoreboard and Metal Dog was at the top, carrying our team to victory. After the match ended, I checked the in-game global leaderboard and verified that this person was indeed the number 1 player in the world, and they were. "Metal Dog, can you talk?? Give us some advice," one of them asked.

Then Metal Dog's mic snapped on, and he proceeded to give some of the best, most sagely advice that I've ever heard in my life:

#### *"When I'm playing the game and I start to get in a rut, start losing or dying a lot, I put down the controller and I take a break. I'll go make myself a sandwich, hang out with my old lady, go on a walk, whatever. I'll just do something else to break the rut."*

--  


This advice from Metal Dog can be extrapolated out of gaming and applied to web development, learning a new language, facing a particularly challenging task at work, or trying just about anything new in life. That lesson is: Take a break every once in awhile if things are getting tough. Walk around. Get in a different mind space for a moment, and consider a new approach.

And you know what? Turns out there is scientific data to back up Metal Dog's philosophy. A 2011 study done by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign concluded that brief diversions from a task can dramatically improve one's ability to focus on that task for long periods of time.

So next time you are facing down a particularly challenging dilemma, consider taking a break. It may very well be the solution to your problem.

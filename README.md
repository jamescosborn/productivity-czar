# Angular Extended Independent Project
by James Osborn

## Topic List
Here are some areas I'd like to focus on improving in order to become a better developer.

### Design
My work at Epicodus has been largely focused on back-end languages. I often don't style my projects, because I'm focused on the functionality first. I'd like to take some lessons on the design side to improve on my ability to give my projects great styles.
* UI/UX Design
* Wireframes
* Photoshop
* Illustrator


### Databases
Being able to manage databases is going to be vital to my future as a back-end developer, both for working for my future employer and for independent projects. It's important that I know the fundamentals of several different databases and their languages, in order to become a developer with a diverse skillset.
* Firebase
* SQL


### Coding with New Languages
Now that I've learned the basics of a few different languages, I feel I'm ready to branch out and learn even more. Ruby and Python have interested me, and I should compare and contrast the two further to decide which one I might want to learn next.

Additionally, I want to keep reviewing and expanding on languages I've learned in the past, to keep those skills sharp and up to date.

* Ruby
* Python
* C++

### Keeping Up With Known Languages

Coding seems to be like a lot of skills in life, if you don't keep using them they degrade over time. It's important that I keep reviewing languages I've learned in the past, both to learn new aspects that I previously didn't know of, and to reinforce all the concepts that I already do know.

* C# and Visual C
* MVC with C#
* .NET
* Asynchrony
* Exception Handling
* Parsing data from API calls



* Project Management
* Game Development & Unity
* Technical Terminology
* Whiteboarding Practice
* Interview Practice
* Creative Writing
* Technical Writing
* Giving Presentations
* Learning Japanese
* Blog posts


## What does it mean to be a good developer?

## Taking a Break: A Lesson From Metal Dog

One weekend in my university days, I was playing a video game called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It was a very popular game at the time, with millions of players worldwide. Over the chat channel I heard someone say, "OMG, it's Metal Dog!! Metal Dog is in our game!!"

"Who's Metal Dog?" someone else asks. Metal Dog, with a bunch of Xs and numbers interspersed in his gamertag, was the Number 1 player in CoD: MW2 on Xbox 360, the first person informed us. I checked the scoreboard and Metal Dog was at the top, carrying our team. After the match ended, I checked the in-game global leaderboard and verified that sure enough, this person was actually the number 1 player in the world. "Metal Dog, can you talk?? Give us some advice," someone asked.

Then Metal Dog's mic snapped on, and he proceeded to give me some of the best advice I've ever heard in my life.

*"When I'm playing the game and I start to get in a rut, start losing or playing poorly, I put down the controller and I take a break. I'll go make myself a sandwich, hang out with my girlfriend, go on a walk, whatever. Just do something else to break the rut."*

**--Metal Dog**, circa 2009

This advice from Metal Dog can be extrapolated out of gaming and applied to web development, learning a new language, facing a particularly challenging task at work, or trying just about anything new in life. That lesson is: Take a break every once in awhile if things are getting tough. Walk around. Get in a different mind space for a moment, and consider a new approach.

And you know what? Turns out there is scientific data to back up Metal Dog's philosophy. A 2011 study done by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign concluded that brief diversions from a task can dramatically improve one's ability to focus on that task for long periods of time.

So next time you are facing down a particularly challenging dilemma, consider taking a break. It may very well be the solution to your problem.

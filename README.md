## What does it mean to be a good developer?

## Taking a Break: A Lesson From Metal Dog

One afternoon in my university days, I was playing a video game called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It was a very popular game at the time, with millions of players worldwide. Over the chat channel I heard someone say, "OMG, it's Metal Dog!! Metal Dog is in our game!!"

"Who's Metal Dog?" someone else asks. Metal Dog, with a bunch of Xs and numbers interspersed in his gamertag, was the Number 1 player in CoD: MW2 on Xbox 360, the first person informed us. I checked the scoreboard and Metal Dog was at the top, carrying our team. After the match ended, I checked the in-game global leaderboard and verified that sure enough, this person was actually the number 1 player in the world. "Metal Dog, can you talk?? Give us some advice," someone asked.

Then Metal Dog's mic snapped on, and he proceeded to give me some of the best advice I've ever heard in my life.

*"When I'm playing the game and I start to get in a rut, start losing, or playing poorly, I put down the controller and I take a break. I'll go make myself a sandwich, hang out with my girlfriend, go on a walk, or just do something else to break the rut."

--Metal Dog, circa 2009*

This advice from Metal Dog can be extrapolated out of gaming and applied to web development, learning a new language, facing a particularly challenging task at work, or trying just about anything new in life. That lesson is: Take a break every once in awhile if things are getting tough. Walk around. Get in a different mind space for a moment, and consider a new approach.

And you know what? Turns out there is scientific data to back up Metal Dog's philosophy. A 2011 study done by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign concluded that brief diversions from a task can dramatically improve one's ability to focus on that task for long periods of time.

So next time you are facing down a particularly challenging dilemma, consider taking a break. It may very well be the solution to your problem.
